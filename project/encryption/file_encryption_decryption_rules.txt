code by: Youssef Mahmoud Abdelwahed

Rules:
-Symmetrical encryption (a single key to encrypt and decrypt)  
-Shifting positions, (as in caesar encryption)
-The key is an integer chosen by the user used as the shifting value
-This encryption is relatively weak against all kind of attacks:
    Only plain_text attack -> as spaces are not emitted by default 
    Known plain_text attack -> it's really clear that it's only shifting
    Chosen plain_text attack -> would be very easy to break it as trying "a"->"b" if the key = 1 would be easy to Known

Implementation:
-Usage of classes, functions
-Breaking the program up into pieces
    first part: file_handling from reading and writing to a new file_handling
    second part: the Cipher class used to initialize a encoder and a decoder with a specified key
