Rules:
-The rules are (length, caps, digits, special_characters)
-The default rules are:
    length = 14 characters
    caps_on = true (allowing capitalized characters)
    digits_on = true (adding random digits to the password)
    special_characters = true (adding special characters to the password)
        -> those characters are: "!"#$%&'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\]^_`{|}~"
-I made the program so that it would be dynamic, where the user can change
 the default rules in a prompt asked everytime he tries to generate a password
-I also added some unnecessary but cool futures: 
    the ability to generate n numbers of passwords with rules x
    the program can be directy called from the console in this format(the command):
        python [fname(the path)] [number of passwords] [caps] [digits] [specials]
-possible improvements:     
    Improving the ux design as it's not that user friendly, mabye making manual for the app printed with the main
